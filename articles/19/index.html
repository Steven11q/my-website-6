    <p>I started this website as a way to teach myself HTML and some more complex networking. It's honestly taught me a lot and I encourage whoever is reading this to go onto github pages and make a simple Jekyll site.&nbsp;</p><p>I started out by trying to use Neocities because it was a free hosting service, but quickly realized that the workflow of adding content to that site by writing html line by line just wasen't going to work for me.&nbsp;</p><p>I then learned about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, and built myself a website using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a> as my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a> (with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ckeditor.com/">CKEDITOR</a> as my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20WYSIWYG%20(%2F%CB%88,web%20page%2C%20or%20slide%20presentation.">WYSIWYG</a> editor, and a plugin to make it work with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>), Jekyll as my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">SSG</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> as my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD">CI/CD</a>. All of this is running in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> containers on my home server. It took some time to get everything intergrated, but works fairly well. I like the fact that this method seperates my home network from all the actual hosting with an airgap, while still allowing me to easily add new content.</p><p>I chose to make my own website sort of from scratch because I wanted the control to choose how each page looked. Building it from scratch also gave me an opportunity to add some fun back to website design with Javasript snippets like Steve the cat on the homepage.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like modern web design standards expects everything to look clean and steril, and in doing so, the web has become too boring. &nbsp;Its a shame to me that html lost marquee and blink, because they were fun. They were tools for people to make a fun little website for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>When designing this website I took a lot of inspiration from archived Geocities pages and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gifcities.org/?q=hampster"><i>gifcities</i></a> from the internet archive.</p>
